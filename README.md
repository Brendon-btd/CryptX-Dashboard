# CryptX-Dashboard
The React & Tailwind Mastery Dashboard is a front-end web application built to demonstrate advanced skills in React.js and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on developing a modern, responsive, and pixel-perfect dashboard interface based on a provided Figma design.

It showcases the ability to create a scalable Single-Page Application (SPA) with efficient state management, clean component architecture, and dynamic routing. Every element — from layout grids to typography — was styled exclusively with Tailwind utility classes, ensuring both design precision and performance optimization.

This project serves as proof of mastery in React front-end development, emphasizing clean code, responsiveness, and real-world design implementation.
